I am a big proponent of unit testing my code because of the many benefits it provides:

* Helps me to catch potential bugs early
* Helps me to clarify the behavior of my units (classes) from a client perspective
* Leaves a documentation trail for those that come behind me to understand my intentions

The only irritation/friction I have found in the past is the fact that running unit tests has required me to manually run them on a periodic basis.  Having keyboard shortcuts has helped to make that fairly painless, but it would have been nice to have the tests automatically run as I am working on the code.  That way I am continually receiving feedback and don't have to explicitly do anything to receive it.

While there have been custom add-on options in the past ([SpecWatchr](https://github.com/amirrajan/SpecWatchr) and [nCrunch](http://www.ncrunch.net/)), Microsoft has finally seen fit to add this functionality right into the Visual Studio 2017 Enterprise version.
