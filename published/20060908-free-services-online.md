I am amazed at the amount of free services being provided on the internet! Will there be a day when I no longer have to maintain my own file share on a local hard drive? Will I be able to store everything out in the "cloud"?

Google has capitalized the market with free services like email, chat, calendaring, and photo albums. They are even offering to let you use their services as a suite for free within your small organization under [your own domain](http://www.google.com/a).  Microsoft and others are trying to catch up with the services bandwagon, but clearly Google is in the lead.
